Importing a Csv tiddler converts the data into Tiddlers, or into one or more Json Tiddlers. The results depend on certain options set on the Csv Tiddler (above) such as Headers, Skip Empty Lines, the Peek / Preview values, etc - as well as the Import rules (below). There are a number of "placeholder variables" used in the import procces as described below. These are not set as tiddlywiki variables, and are only used when the import is performed.

The filters shown below will be reset to [[defaults|$:/config/application/csv]] when the tiddler is re-rendered unless saved by clicking the checkmark next to the input.
